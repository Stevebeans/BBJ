-- This page will pull from the relationship table and look up which player is connected to the season # and not evicted or in jury and display them in the loop. 


Current Status Bar 

-- This bar will just be a list of any player I make and the dropdowns that apply to them.  Jury, HoH, etc.  I don't think it should be tied in with any Relationship becuase it would be too many queries to pull through who is evicted and when.
